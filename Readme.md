# PROG 366 Algorithms Portfolio

This is a portfolio documenting my understanding and progress learning algorithms

## Week 2

This week I implemented methods that illustrate my understanding of three big-O time compleities:

- [**Constant Time O(1)**]
- [**Linear Time O(n)**]
- [**Quadratic time O(n^2)**]
