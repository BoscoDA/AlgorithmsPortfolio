# PROG 366 Algorithms Portfolio

This is a portfolio documenting my understanding and progress learning algorithms

## Week 2

This week I implemented methods that illustrate my understanding of three big-O time compleities:

- [**Constant Time O(1)**]
- [**Linear Time O(n)**]
- [**Quadratic time O(n^2)**]

## Week 5

This week was about the Fisher Yates Shuffle. The Fisher Yates Shuffle is a algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence
