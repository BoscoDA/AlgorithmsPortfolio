# PROG 366 Algorithms Portfolio

This is first and foremost a portfolio  documenting my progress learning algorithms throughout the my fall 2022 semester at Columbia College Chicago. When finished it will be a semi-living library of algorithms and algorithm information for easy to access future use.

## Week 1
- Added project to demonstrate my understanding of constant, linear and quadratic time.

## Week 5:
- Added project to demonstrate the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.

## Week 8-9
- Added a project to demonstrate the use of arrays, hash tables, queues and stacks.
- Also added a simple implementation of a linked list.
